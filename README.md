# Weather Dashboard

## Description

The Weather Dashboard is a web application that provides real-time and future weather forecasts for any searched city. By leveraging the OpenWeather API, users can view current weather conditions and a 5-day forecast, including temperature, humidity, wind speed, and weather icons. The application also stores search history, allowing users to revisit previous city searches.

This project demonstrates API integration, server-side data handling, and front-end rendering to deliver a seamless user experience.
